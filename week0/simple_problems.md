A bunch of simple problems, to warm up with Python. Those are the regular programming problems, that you meet in every beginners course.

The solutions should be written for Python 3.* verion.

## Problem 0

The most annoying problem of all. Write a function, called ```nth_fibonacci(n)``` that returns the n-th fibonacci number, given by the argument.

The signature should look like this:

```python
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    #implementation here
```

And here are few test examples of the output:

```
>>> nth_fibonacci(1)
1
>>> nth_fibonacci(2)
1
>>> nth_fibonacci(3)
2
>>> nth_fibonacci(10)
55
>>>
```
