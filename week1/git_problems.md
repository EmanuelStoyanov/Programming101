We are going to make baby steps with Git and Github.

## Problem 0 - README more

Update your ```README.md``` file to be more descriptive of your repository.

Here, ```.md``` stands for markdown, which is a language for formatting text. This very file is written in markdown.

Try to format it, using this cheatsheet - https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet.

Markdown is intuitive and you will soon feel it.

## Problem 1 - week0 to Github

It's time to bring your solutions from week0 to Github!

Organize your repository the following way:

```
/nth-fibonacci/solution.py
/nth-fibonacci/tests.py
...
```

For each problem - create a folder with proper name.

* ```solution.py``` is the file with the implemented function
* ```tests.py``` is the file with unit tests for the given problem. Don't worry for the tests for now.

Make sure you create one commit for each problem. We don't want all files in one commit!

## Problem 2 - Fork, Clone & Pull Request

Fork the following repo: https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Programming101/. Look for the ```fork``` button in the upper-right corner.

After this, clone it to your computer and start looking for typos and something that is not correct.

You can even add a problem, if you want to!

Commit & Push to the forked repo. And when you are ready - Open a pull request to the original repository!
